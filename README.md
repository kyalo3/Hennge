# Mission 1: Write a program which fulfills the requirements below
# Description
**We want you to calculate the sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.*
The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), indicating the number of test cases to follow.
Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.

# Note: There should be no output until all the input has been received.
# Note 2: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
# Note 3: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.

# Rules
**Write your solution using Go Programming Language or Python Programming Language. Do not submit your solution with both languages at once!*

# Specific rules for Python solution:
Your source code must be a single file, containing at least a main function
Do not use any for loop, while loop, or any list / set / dictionary comprehension
Your solution will be tested against Python 3.12 (as of April 2024) or higher

**def main():*
    *...*

*if __name__ == "__main__":*
    *main()*
